# Refactor Dynamic Lesson Content Loading with Zod Validation

## Summary
Refactored LessonPage.tsx to use a dedicated DynamicLessonContent component with runtime content validation using Zod. This improves code maintainability, robustness, and user experience.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Zod Dependency
- Installed zod@3.25.67 for runtime schema validation
- Enables type-safe validation of lesson content data

### 2. Enhanced LessonContentTypes.ts
- Added comprehensive Zod schemas for all lesson types (Vocabulary, Grammar, Conversation)
- Created `validateLessonContent()` function for centralized validation
- Added `lessonContentSchemaMap` for type-to-schema mapping
- Provides detailed error messages for validation failures

### 3. Created DynamicLessonContent Component
- New file: `client/src/components/learning/content/DynamicLessonContent.tsx`
- Handles all lesson rendering logic with validation
- Separates presentation logic from page logic (Single Responsibility Principle)
- Provides robust error handling for malformed content
- Uses React.Suspense for proper loading states

### 4. Refactored LessonPage.tsx
- Simplified by delegating content rendering to DynamicLessonContent
- Removed ~20 lines of complex inline rendering logic
- Cleaner separation of concerns: page logic vs. content rendering
- Maintained all existing functionality (completion, navigation, etc.)

### 5. Updated Documentation
- Marked subtasks 2.4.2.1 through 2.4.2.4 as completed in app_overhaul_plan.md
- Documented the refactoring approach and implementation details

## Technical Benefits

### Before
- Complex immediately-invoked function within JSX
- Reactive error handling with try/catch
- No content validation - could crash on malformed data
- Tightly coupled rendering and page logic

### After
- Clean component delegation with single responsibility
- Proactive error prevention with Zod validation
- Specific, actionable error messages
- Future-proof: easy to add new lesson types
- Performance optimized with useMemo

## Validation Results
- Application loads without errors
- Lesson content renders correctly for valid data
- Invalid content displays user-friendly error messages (e.g., "items: Required")
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Impact
- Improved code maintainability and readability
- Enhanced user experience with better error handling
- Increased application robustness against data corruption
- Foundation for future lesson type additions
