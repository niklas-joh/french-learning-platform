# Performance Considerations for Content Generation

## Database Optimization
- Indexes on ai_generated_content table for fast lookups
- Composite index for cache queries (userId, type, level, status)
- JSON field optimization for large content objects

## Caching Strategy
- User context caching to avoid repeated database queries
- Generated content caching based on similarity
- Template caching for faster content structuring

## AI API Optimization
- Token usage optimization per content type
- Temperature settings for consistency vs creativity balance
- Rate limiting to prevent cost overruns

## Memory Management
- Lazy loading of user context data
- Streaming for large content responses
- Garbage collection optimization for long-running processes

## Scalability Considerations
- Stateless service design for horizontal scaling
- Database connection pooling
- Async processing for non-blocking content generation
