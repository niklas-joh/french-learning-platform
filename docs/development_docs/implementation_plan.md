## **Risk Mitigation**

### **Technical Risks**
- **API Cost Overrun**: Implement usage caps and monitoring
- **Database Performance**: Start with SQLite, plan PostgreSQL migration
- **Authentication Security**: Use proven JWT libraries and best practices

### **Project Risks**
- **Scope Creep**: Stick to phase-based development
- **Timeline Delays**: Focus on MVP first, enhance iteratively
- **Complexity Management**: Use TypeScript and clear documentation
