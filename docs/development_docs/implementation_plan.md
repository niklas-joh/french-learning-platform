# French Learning Platform - Implementation Plan

## **Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)**
### **MVP Core Features**
- [✅] Project setup with React + Node.js + TypeScript
- [✅] Basic authentication system (register/login) - Frontend UI, API service layer, and component integration complete.
- [✅] SQLite database setup with core tables
- [✅] Simple quiz interface (multiple choice only)
- [✅] Basic user dashboard (quizzes displayed)
- [✅] Content storage system (JSON files)

### **Deliverables**
- Working authentication
- Basic quiz functionality
- User can take quizzes and see results
- Simple progress tracking

---

## **Phase 2: Content Management Module (Weeks 3-4)**
### **Core Content System**
- [✅] **Admin Authentication:** Finalize admin authentication and role management (Admin user provisioning script functional; RBAC middleware and protected routes pending).
- [✅] **Define/Refine Database Schema:** Detailed schema for `content`, `topics`, `categories` (if distinct from topics), and their relationships. See [ERD](./database_schema.mermaid).
- [✅] **Database Migrations:** Create/update Knex migrations for the defined content schema. Ensure they are idempotent and handle existing data if applicable.
- [✅] **Backend API (CRUD):** Develop robust RESTful API endpoints for managing topics and content items.
    - Endpoints: e.g., `/api/admin/topics`, `/api/admin/content`.
    - Operations: Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for both topics and content items.
    - Security: Secure all endpoints with admin-only access (`protect` and `isAdmin` middleware).
    - Validation: Implement input validation for all API requests.
- [✅] **Frontend Admin UI:** Design and implement React components and pages for administrators to:
    - [✅] View, create, edit, and delete topics/categories. (Create: ✅, Read: ✅, Update: ✅, Delete: ✅)
    - [✅] View, create, edit, and delete content items (e.g., individual questions, grammar rules, vocabulary entries). (Create: ✅, Read: ✅, Update: ✅, Delete: ✅)
    - [✅] Associate content items with relevant topics/categories.
    - [✅] Manage content metadata (e.g., difficulty, tags).
    - [✅] View basic analytics on the admin dashboard.
    - [✅] Assign content to users (Admin UI).
    - [✅] Display assigned content on user dashboard.
- [✅] **Content Population Strategy:**
    - [✅] **Initial Population Script:** A script to bulk-populate the `content` and `topics` tables from existing JSON files has been created and executed, populating the initial dataset.
    - [✅] **Admin UI Population:** Enable content creation and management directly through the new Admin UI as an ongoing process.
- [✅] **Enhanced User Features**
- [✅] Multiple content types (grammar, vocabulary, etc.)
- [✅] Basic progress visualization
- [✅] User preference settings

---

## **Phase 2.5: Dashboard Revamp (Parallel to early Phase 3)**
### **Dashboard User Experience Enhancements**
- [✅] **Personalized Welcome:** Display user's name instead of email.
- [✅] **Clickable Progress Cards:** Enable navigation from progress elements.
- [✅] **'Assigned Content' Improvements:**
    - [✅] Refactored data model to separate explicit assignments from ad-hoc completions, fixing progress calculation bugs.
    - [✅] Correctly display content titles in the assigned content list.
    - [✅] Show all incomplete items with a "View All" option.
    - [✅] Filter out completed items from the main list.
    - [✅] User-friendly layout: formatted names and icons for content types.
    - [✅] **Assignments Page Enhancements:** Added status column (Pending, In Progress, Completed, Overdue) and filter controls (Status, Topic placeholder, Journey placeholder) to the "All Assigned Content" page.
- [ ] **'Explore Topics' Styling:** Implement cards with descriptions and navigation.
- [ ] **Intuitive Page Structure:** Redesign dashboard layout for better flow (learning, assignments, exploration, progress).
- [ ] **Detailed Plan:** Refer to [Dashboard Enhancement Plan](./dashboard_enhancement_plan.md) for specifics.

### **Deliverables**
- Revamped user dashboard with improved usability and aesthetics.
- Clearer presentation of assigned content and learning paths.
- Enhanced navigation and user engagement.
