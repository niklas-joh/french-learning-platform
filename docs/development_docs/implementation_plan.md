# French Learning Platform - Implementation Plan

## **Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)**
### **MVP Core Features**
- [✅] Project setup with React + Node.js + TypeScript
- [✅] Basic authentication system (register/login) - Frontend UI, API service layer, and component integration complete.
- [✅] SQLite database setup with core tables
- [✅] Simple quiz interface (multiple choice only)
- [✅] Basic user dashboard (quizzes displayed)
- [✅] Content storage system (JSON files)

### **Deliverables**
- Working authentication
- Basic quiz functionality
- User can take quizzes and see results
- Simple progress tracking

---

## **Phase 2: Content Management Module (Weeks 3-4)**
### **Core Content System**
- [ ] **Define/Refine Database Schema:** Detailed schema for `content`, `topics`, `categories` (if distinct from topics), and their relationships. Document ERD.
- [ ] **Database Migrations:** Create/update Knex migrations for the defined content schema. Ensure they are idempotent and handle existing data if applicable.
- [ ] **Backend API (CRUD):** Develop robust RESTful API endpoints for managing topics and content items.
    - Endpoints: e.g., `/api/admin/topics`, `/api/admin/content`.
    - Operations: Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for both topics and content items.
    - Security: Secure all endpoints with admin-only access (`protect` and `isAdmin` middleware).
    - Validation: Implement input validation for all API requests.
- [ ] **Frontend Admin UI:** Design and implement React components and pages for administrators to:
    - [ ] View, create, edit, and delete topics/categories.
    - [ ] View, create, edit, and delete content items (e.g., individual questions, grammar rules, vocabulary entries).
    - [ ] Associate content items with relevant topics/categories.
    - [ ] Manage content metadata (e.g., difficulty, tags).
- [ ] **Content Population Strategy:**
    - [ ] **Initial Population Script:** Develop a script to bulk-populate the `content` and `topics` tables from existing JSON files (e.g., `content/topics/**/*.json`). This is the immediate next task to get initial data into the system.
    - [ ] **Admin UI Population:** Enable content creation and management directly through the new Admin UI as an ongoing process.

## **Risk Mitigation**

### **Technical Risks**
- **API Cost Overrun**: Implement usage caps and monitoring
- **Database Performance**: Start with SQLite, plan PostgreSQL migration
- **Authentication Security**: Use proven JWT libraries and best practices

### **Project Risks**
- **Scope Creep**: Stick to phase-based development
- **Timeline Delays**: Focus on MVP first, enhance iteratively
- **Complexity Management**: Use TypeScript and clear documentation
