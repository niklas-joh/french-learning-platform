## First review
Identify the next task in @/docs\development_docs\app_overhaul_plan.md  following the PRD in @/docs/development_docs/language_learning_prd.md 

Conduct a detailed analysis of your approach, impacted files, dependencies, and create concrete developing suggestions. Consider impacts on Architecture and technical documents, plans etc., before starting any code work.

Make sure it is future-proof, following best coding standards, and reuses existing content whenever possible. Follow KISS.

## Second review
What are the changes needed in these files, and are there other files that needs update (e.g. @/docs\development_docs\architecture\system_architecture.mermaid , @/database\schema.sql  or other high-level overview documents)? Expand the tasks into subtask if larger changes, update the @/docs\development_docs\app_overhaul_plan.md with the subtasks and tackle them one by one.

## Third and final review
Now criticise your approach, identifying flaws or ineffiencies, validate that you are reusing existing logic, follow best coding practices, and think of performance and efficient functionalities. When you find a better coding option, implement this in the code instead. If the change is too large to do under this scope, add it as a subtask in @/docs\development_docs\app_overhaul_plan.md, capture it as a TODO within the code with clear explanations. If outside current scope, add it as a future implementation in @/docs\development_docs\future_implementation_considerations.md
