# Task 3.1.A.4: AI Orchestration - Core Implementation

## **Task Information**
- **Parent Task**: 3.1.A
- **Estimated Time**: 2 hours
- **Priority**: üî• Critical
- **Dependencies**: 3.1.A.3
- **Status**: ‚è≥ Not Started

## **Objective**
Implement the core logic of the `AIOrchestrator` service. This includes the main `orchestrateRequest` method, which acts as the central pipeline for all AI-related requests, and its private helper methods that handle caching, rate limiting, context enhancement, and fallbacks.

## **Success Criteria**
- [ ] The `AIOrchestrator` class is created in `server/src/services/aiOrchestrator.ts`.
- [ ] The constructor correctly accepts and stores its dependencies (Dependency Injection).
- [ ] The main `orchestrateRequest` method is implemented with the full request lifecycle pipeline.
- [ ] Private helper methods for each step of the pipeline are implemented.
- [ ] The implementation uses `object-hash` for reliable cache key generation.
- [ ] The code is well-documented and follows the refined architecture.

## **Implementation Details**
This subtask brings together the supporting services created in the previous step into a cohesive workflow.

### **1. `AIOrchestrator` Class and Constructor**
The class will be designed to receive its dependencies (like `CacheService`, `RateLimitService`, etc.) through its constructor, adhering to the Dependency Injection pattern.

### **2. `orchestrateRequest` Pipeline**
This central method will execute the following steps in order:
1.  Check rate limits using `RateLimitService`.
2.  Check for a cached response using `CacheService`.
3.  If no cache hit, retrieve user context using `ContextService`.
4.  Enhance the request with the user context.
5.  Execute the actual AI request to the OpenAI API.
6.  Process and validate the AI's response.
7.  Cache the new response.
8.  Handle any errors gracefully using a fallback strategy.

### **3. Helper Methods**
Private methods like `checkRateLimit`, `checkCache`, `enhanceRequest`, `executeAIRequest`, `processResponse`, `cacheResponse`, and `handleFallback` will encapsulate the logic for each step of the pipeline, keeping the main `orchestrateRequest` method clean and readable.

## **Files to Create/Modify**
- `server/src/services/aiOrchestrator.ts` (Create)

## **Validation**
1. Verify the `AIOrchestrator.ts` file is created.
2. Review the code to ensure the `orchestrateRequest` method follows the defined pipeline logic.
3. Confirm that dependency injection is used correctly in the constructor.
4. The project should compile without errors.
