# Task 3.1.A.2: AI Orchestration - Core Types & Interfaces

## **Task Information**
- **Parent Task**: 3.1.A
- **Estimated Time**: 0.5 hours
- **Priority**: ðŸ”¥ Critical
- **Dependencies**: 3.1.A.1
- **Status**: âœ… Completed

## **Objective**
Define a comprehensive set of TypeScript types and interfaces to create a strong, type-safe contract for the entire AI orchestration system. This foundational step ensures data consistency and improves developer experience by enabling autocompletion and compile-time checks.

## **Success Criteria**
- [x] A new `server/src/types/AI.ts` file is created.
- [x] The file contains all necessary interfaces: `AIRequest`, `AIResponse`, `OrchestrationConfig`, `ContextData`, and related strategy types.
- [x] Types are well-documented with JSDoc comments explaining their purpose.
- [x] The type definitions align with the refined architecture (e.g., including `redisUrl` in `OrchestrationConfig`).

## **Implementation Details**
A single file will be created to house all types related to the AI services. This centralizes the data structures, making them easy to import and reference throughout the server application.

### **Core Types to be Defined:**
- **`AIRequest`**: Represents any request flowing into the orchestrator.
- **`AIResponse`**: The standardized response structure from the orchestrator.
- **`OrchestrationConfig`**: The shape of the configuration object, including API keys and service settings.
- **`ContextData`**: The structure for user-specific context used for personalization.
- **`CacheStrategy`, `RateLimitStrategy`, `FallbackStrategy`**: Interfaces defining the configuration for the various strategies the orchestrator will employ.

## **Files to Create/Modify**
- `server/src/types/AI.ts` (Create)

## **Validation**
1. Verify the new file `server/src/types/AI.ts` exists.
2. Review the file to ensure all required interfaces are present and correctly defined.
3. The project should continue to compile without errors after this file is added.
