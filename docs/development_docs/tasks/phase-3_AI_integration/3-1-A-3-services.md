# Task 3.1.A.3: AI Orchestration - Supporting Services

## **Task Information**
- **Parent Task**: 3.1.A
- **Estimated Time**: 2 hours
- **Priority**: ðŸ”¥ Critical
- **Dependencies**: 3.1.A.2
- **Status**: âœ… Completed

## **Objective**
Implement the modular, reusable services that the `AIOrchestrator` will depend on. This subtask focuses on creating robust, scalable services for caching and rate limiting using Redis, and a foundational service for context management.

## **Success Criteria**
- [x] A new `server/src/services/ai/CacheService.ts` file is created and implemented using `ioredis`.
- [x] A new `server/src/services/ai/RateLimitService.ts` file is created and implemented using `ioredis` for distributed rate limiting.
- [x] A new `server/src/services/ai/FallbackHandler.ts` file is created and implemented.
- [ ] A new `server/src/services/contextService.ts` file is created with a stubbed implementation for loading user context.
- [ ] Placeholder files for `aiMetricsService.ts` and `promptTemplateEngine.ts` are created to satisfy future dependencies.
- [x] The services are designed to accept dependencies (like a Redis client) via their constructors (Dependency Injection).

## **Implementation Details**

### **1. Cache Service (`cacheService.ts`)**
This service will provide a simple `get`/`set` interface for caching AI responses. It will use Redis to ensure the cache is distributed and persistent across server restarts.

### **2. Rate Limiting Service (`rateLimitService.ts`)**
This service will manage API call frequency. By using Redis's atomic operations, it will correctly handle rate limits even in a multi-instance deployment.

### **3. Context Service (`contextService.ts`)**
This service will be responsible for fetching and managing user-specific context. For this initial task, the data loading will be a stub, returning mock data. The full database integration will be a future task.

### **4. Stubbed Services**
To prepare for future development and avoid compilation errors, empty placeholder classes will be created for `AIMetricsService` and `PromptTemplateEngine`.

## **Files to Create/Modify**
- `server/src/services/cacheService.ts` (Create)
- `server/src/services/rateLimitService.ts` (Create)
- `server/src/services/contextService.ts` (Create)
- `server/src/services/aiMetricsService.ts` (Create - Stub)
- `server/src/services/promptTemplateEngine.ts` (Create - Stub)

## **Validation**
1. Verify the new service files are created in the `server/src/services/` directory.
2. Review the code to ensure Redis is used for `CacheService` and `RateLimitService`.
3. Confirm that services are designed to receive dependencies through their constructors.
4. The project should compile without errors.
