# Task CC6.4: Finalize Deployment Documentation

- **Goal**: Ensure all public docs reflect camelCase conventions and deployment steps.
- **Steps**:
  1. Search `README.md` and `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` for outdated snake_case examples or references.
  2. Update command snippets and configuration paths to match the camelCase schema.
  3. Include notes on when to run backups and where to find rollback instructions.
- **Deliverable**: Updated documentation in the repository root that guides deployers through the camelCase rollout.
