# Task CC4.3: Update Components and Pages

- **Goal**: Migrate all React components and pages to use camelCase prop names and data fields.
- **Steps**:
  1. Search `client/src/components/` and `client/src/pages/` for snake_case prop names or form field identifiers.
  2. Rename component props and update corresponding usages where they are consumed.
  3. Adjust any form `name` attributes or input handlers to align with camelCase payloads.
  4. Verify that integrations with services or hooks pass camelCase data end-to-end.
- **Deliverable**: Components and page modules free of snake_case references.
