# Future Implementation Considerations

This document tracks architectural improvements, refactoring opportunities, and larger-scale changes that have been identified but are outside the scope of immediate tasks.

## 1. Adopt TanStack Query for Server State Management
- **Identified**: During the implementation of the Learning Path feature (Phase 2).
- **Current State**: We are using basic custom React hooks (`useLearningPath`) for data fetching.
- **Problem**: Our custom hooks are functional but lack caching, automatic refetching on window focus, request deduplication, and other crucial performance optimizations. This leads to redundant API calls and a less responsive user experience.
- **Proposed Solution**: Adopt a dedicated server-state management library like TanStack Query (formerly React Query).
- **Benefits**:
  - Centralize all data fetching logic.
  - Reduce boilerplate code significantly.
  - Improve application performance and responsiveness out-of-the-box.
  - Provide a better user experience with features like stale-while-revalidate.

## 2. Implement API Pagination for Large Data Sets
- **Identified**: During the implementation of the Learning Path feature (Phase 2).
- **Current State**: The `/api/learning-paths/:pathId/user-view` endpoint fetches the entire learning path, including all units and lessons, in a single request.
- **Problem**: For large learning paths (e.g., 50+ lessons), this can result in a very large JSON payload, increasing initial load times and memory usage.
- **Proposed Solution**: Refactor the backend API to support pagination or per-unit fetching. The client would initially fetch the list of units, and then fetch the lessons for each unit as it becomes visible.
- **Benefits**:
  - Drastically reduces initial payload size.
  - Improves perceived performance, as the user sees the first part of the path much faster.
  - Reduces server load.

## 3. Virtualize Long Lists for Performance
- **Identified**: During the implementation of the Learning Path feature (Phase 2).
- **Current State**: The `LearningPath.tsx` component maps over all units and renders them directly.
- **Problem**: Rendering a large number of DOM nodes (e.g., for a path with 20+ units and 100+ lessons) can cause performance issues, especially on mobile devices.
- **Proposed Solution**: Implement a list virtualization library like `react-window` or `react-virtual` for the learning path view.
- **Benefits**:
  - Ensures high performance regardless of the number of lessons by only rendering the items currently in the viewport.
  - Keeps the UI smooth and responsive.

## 4. Dynamic `pathId` Selection
- **Identified**: During the implementation of the Learning Path feature (Phase 2).
- **Current State**: The `pathId` is hardcoded to `1` in `LessonsPage.tsx`.
- **Problem**: The user cannot switch between different learning paths (e.g., "French for Beginners" vs. "Business French").
- **Proposed Solution**:
  1. Create a new API endpoint to list all available learning paths.
  2. Implement a UI element (e.g., a dropdown or a selection page) that allows the user to choose a learning path.
  3. Store the selected `pathId` in global state or as a URL parameter and pass it dynamically to the `LearningPath` component.
