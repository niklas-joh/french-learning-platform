# Task CC1.3: Catalogue Frontend Source

- **Goal**: List all client-side files that reference snake_case fields from API responses or payloads.
- **Steps**:
  1. Search `client/src/` for underscores in property names or API response mappings.
  2. Focus on services, context providers, hooks, and components that parse backend data.
  3. Note existing comments that mention converting snake_case to camelCase.
- **Deliverable**: A report outlining which frontend modules will require updates during the migration.
