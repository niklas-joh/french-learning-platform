# Task CC1.5: Outline Migration Strategy

- **Goal**: Draft a clear plan for renaming tables and fields with minimal downtime.
- **Steps**:
  1. Decide on the preferred camelCase conventions (e.g., `createdAt`, `userId`).
  2. Determine backup and rollback procedures before altering the database.
  3. Confirm that the updated schema remains compatible with PostgreSQL.
  4. Document tooling or scripts needed for data transformation during migration.
- **Deliverable**: A migration blueprint summarizing conventions, backups, and tooling requirements.
