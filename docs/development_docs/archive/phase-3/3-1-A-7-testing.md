# Task 3.1.A.7: AI Orchestration - Unit & Integration Testing

## **Task Information**
- **Parent Task**: 3.1.A
- **Estimated Time**: 1 hour
- **Priority**: ⚡ High
- **Dependencies**: 3.1.A.6
- **Status**: ⏳ Not Started

## **Objective**
Create a comprehensive suite of unit and integration tests to validate the functionality, reliability, and correctness of the entire AI Orchestration service and its supporting components.

## **Success Criteria**
- [ ] Unit tests are created for `CacheService`, `RateLimitService`, and `ContextService`.
- [ ] A detailed unit test suite is created for `AIOrchestrator`, mocking its dependencies (especially the OpenAI API) to test its internal logic.
- [ ] Tests cover all key scenarios, including cache hits, rate limiting, and fallback mechanisms.
- [ ] Integration tests are created for the new AI API endpoints to validate the end-to-end flow.
- [ ] All new code has a reasonable level of test coverage.

## **Implementation Details**

### **1. Unit Testing Services**
Each supporting service will have its own test file. The tests for `CacheService` and `RateLimitService` will require a mock Redis client to ensure they can be tested without a running Redis instance.

### **2. Unit Testing the Orchestrator**
The `AIOrchestrator` test suite will be the most complex. It will involve:
-   Mocking all injected dependencies (`CacheService`, `RateLimitService`, etc.).
-   Mocking the `OpenAI` client to simulate successful API calls, API errors, and different types of responses.
-   Testing the `orchestrateRequest` pipeline logic to ensure it calls the correct services in the correct order.
-   Verifying that caching, rate limiting, and fallback logic are triggered under the appropriate conditions.

### **3. Integration Testing the API**
An integration test file for `aiRoutes.ts` will be created. Using `supertest`, it will make mock HTTP requests to the live API endpoints (e.g., `POST /api/ai/generate-content`) and assert that the responses are correct. These tests will validate the entire flow from the router, through the controller, to the service layer.

## **Files to Create/Modify**
- `server/src/services/__tests__/aiOrchestrator.test.ts` (Create)
- `server/src/services/__tests__/cacheService.test.ts` (Create)
- `server/src/services/__tests__/rateLimitService.test.ts` (Create)
- `server/src/routes/__tests__/ai.routes.test.ts` (Create)

## **Validation**
1. Run the test suite (e.g., `npm test` in the `server` directory).
2. Confirm that all new tests pass successfully.
3. Check the test coverage report to ensure adequate coverage of the new AI service files.
