# Task 3.1.A.1: AI Orchestration - Setup & Configuration

## **Task Information**
- **Parent Task**: 3.1.A
- **Estimated Time**: 1 hour
- **Priority**: üî• Critical
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Status**: ‚è≥ Completed

## **Objective**
Prepare the server environment for the AI Orchestration service by installing necessary dependencies and establishing a robust configuration foundation. This initial setup is critical for all subsequent AI-related development.

## **Success Criteria**
- [x] `server/package.json` is updated with `openai`, `ioredis`, and `object-hash`.
- [x] `.env.example` includes `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `REDIS_URL` variables.
- [x] A new `server/src/config/aiConfig.ts` file is created to centralize AI service configurations.
- [x] The application successfully installs the new dependencies (`npm install`).

## **Implementation Details**

### **1. Dependency Installation**
The following packages will be added to `server/package.json`:
- **`openai`**: The official Node.js library for interacting with the OpenAI API.
- **`ioredis`**: A high-performance, full-featured Redis client for Node.js, necessary for caching, rate limiting, and session management.
- **`object-hash`**: A utility to generate reliable, deterministic hashes from JavaScript objects, crucial for creating consistent cache keys.

### **2. Environment Configuration**
The `.env.example` file will be updated to include the necessary secrets and connection strings for the AI services. This ensures that developers know which environment variables to set up locally.

### **3. Centralized AI Configuration**
A new file, `aiConfig.ts`, will be created to export a single configuration object. This practice prevents configuration settings from being scattered across multiple files and makes them easier to manage and modify.

## **Files to Create/Modify**
- `server/package.json` (Modify)
- `.env.example` (Modify)
- `server/src/config/aiConfig.ts` (Create)

## **Validation**
1. Run `npm install` within the `server` directory and confirm it completes without errors.
2. Check that the new dependencies are present in `server/node_modules`.
3. Verify the new configuration variables are documented in `.env.example`.
