# Task CC4.1: Update API Service Layer

- **Status**: `âœ… Completed`
- **Goal**: Ensure all client-side services send and receive camelCase fields only.
- **Steps**:
  1. Search `client/src/services/` for snake_case patterns using `grep '_' -R` to locate outdated field names.
  2. Update request payload builders to use camelCase keys when sending data to the backend.
  3. Adjust response handling logic and remove any utilities that convert snake_case to camelCase.
  4. Verify TypeScript return types remain accurate after renaming.
- **Notes**:
  - All services in `client/src/services/` have been updated to use `camelCase`.
- **Deliverable**: Service modules in `client/src/services/` referencing camelCase properties exclusively.
