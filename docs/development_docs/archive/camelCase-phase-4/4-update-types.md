# Task CC4.4: Update TypeScript Types

- **Status**: `âœ… Completed`
- **Goal**: Ensure type definitions reflect the camelCase schema and API contract.
- **Steps**:
  1. Inspect interfaces in `client/src/types/` for snake_case property names.
  2. Rename these properties to camelCase and update any derived types or enums.
  3. Search the codebase for imports of the renamed interfaces and adjust references accordingly.
  4. Compile the client (`npm --prefix client run build`) to confirm there are no type errors.
- **Notes**:
  - All types in `client/src/types/` have been updated to use `camelCase`.
- **Deliverable**: TypeScript definition files using camelCase properties with successful compilation.
