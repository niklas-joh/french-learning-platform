# Task CC5.3: Update Client-Side Tests

- **Goal**: Ensure front-end tests reflect camelCase API contracts and component props.
- **Steps**:
  1. Search `client/src` for test files referencing snake_case fields using `grep '_' -R *.test*`.
  2. Adjust mocks, fixtures, and assertions to camelCase naming.
  3. Run the client test suite (e.g., `npm --prefix client test`) to confirm there are no failures.
  4. Verify that mocked API calls and component props are consistent with the backend changes.
- **Deliverable**: Client tests updated to expect camelCase data and passing successfully.
